title: "Hallucitation Detection"
subtitle: "Analyzing patterns of AI-hallucinated citations in academic papers"
---

## Overview

This project investigates where, why, and how often AI-assisted writing produces fabricated citations in submitted and accepted academic papers. Using a combination of automated detection and systematic manual coding, the study tests three pre-registered hypotheses about the conditions that predict citation hallucination.

## Research Questions

**RQ1 — Expertise**
Are hallucinated citations more likely when an author cites outside their primary domain of expertise?

**RQ2 — Domain Velocity**
Do fields with faster publication cycles show higher hallucination rates than slower-moving fields?

**RQ3 — Location**
Do hallucinations cluster in particular sections of a paper (e.g., Related Work vs. Methods)?

## Study Design

Papers are sampled using stratified random selection across academic venues representing fields with markedly different publication velocities. The sample targets approximately 300–400 papers.

Each paper passes through a four-phase pipeline:

| Phase | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Collection | Stratified sampling and PDF acquisition |
| 1 | Extraction | Automated citation extraction and hallucination scoring |
| 2 | Coding | Manual coding of expertise and citation characteristics |
| 3 | Analysis | Hypothesis testing and visualisation |

## Detection Approach

Potential hallucinations are flagged by combining two signals:

- **CrossRef verification** — each extracted citation is queried against CrossRef; low match scores indicate the cited work may not exist
- **GPTZero scoring** — surrounding context is evaluated for AI-generated text signatures

Flagged citations are then reviewed manually against the coding scheme described in the [Codebook](codebook.qmd).
