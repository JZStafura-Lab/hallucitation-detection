This codebook governs Phase 2 coding. All coders should read it fully before beginning and refer to it when edge cases arise.

## Author Expertise (Phase 2A)

### Variable: `Expertise_Match`

Measures how well the paper's topic aligns with each key author's demonstrated expertise, based on their published record.

| Code | Label | Criterion |
|------|-------|-----------|
| `0` | Core | Paper domain exactly matches ≥ 1 key author's primary domain |
| `1` | Adjacent | Related field or overlapping methods, but a different subarea |
| `2` | Distant | Outside both key authors' documented publication history |

**Coding procedure**:

1. Identify the **two key authors** — typically first and last/corresponding author.
2. Locate each author's Google Scholar or institutional profile.
3. Record their **primary domain(s)** and **five most-cited papers**.
4. Classify the **paper's own primary domain**.
5. Assign the most lenient match across the two authors (e.g., if one is Core, code `0`).

**Examples**:

- NLP paper + author with 5+ NLP papers → **Core (0)**
- Video generation paper + image classification expert → **Adjacent (1)**
- Ocean modeling paper + pure ML researchers → **Distant (2)**

## Citation Characteristics (Phase 2B)

### Variable: `Citation_Domain`

Classify the cited work's primary field using the standardised list below. Assign the single best-fit label.

| Label | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| NLP / Language Models | Natural language processing, LLMs, text generation |
| Computer Vision | Image/video recognition, generation, segmentation |
| Robotics / Embodied AI | Physical systems, simulation, embodied agents |
| ML Theory / Optimization | Learning theory, convergence, gradient methods |
| Reinforcement Learning | RL algorithms, policy learning, reward modeling |
| Graphs / Networks | Graph neural networks, network analysis |
| Biomedical / Comp. Bio. | Genomics, clinical informatics, computational biology |
| Economics / Finance | Economic theory, empirical economics, finance |
| Political Science | Comparative politics, IR, political behavior |
| Sociology | Social structures, institutions, collective behavior |
| Psychology / Cog. Sci. | Cognition, behavior, psycholinguistics |
| Other | Does not fit above categories |

### Variable: `Citation_Role`

What function does the citation serve in the paper?

| Code | Label | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `B` | Background | General context or prior-work overview |
| `M` | Methods | A specific technique, algorithm, or tool adopted by the paper |
| `R` | Related Work | Direct comparison to a similar approach |
| `E` | Empirical | A dataset, benchmark, or empirical finding cited |
| `T` | Theoretical | A mathematical result, proof, or formal theorem |

### Variable: `Distance_from_Paper` *(auto-calculated)*

| Code | Label | Criterion |
|------|-------|-----------|
| `0` | Core | Citation domain matches the paper's domain |
| `1` | Peripheral | Citation domain is outside the paper's domain |

---

### Variable: `Recency_Category` *(auto-calculated from publication years)*

| Code | Label |
|------|-------|
| `0` | Very Recent (0–1 yr before submission) |
| `1` | Recent (2–5 yr) |
| `2` | Moderate (6–10 yr) |
| `3` | Old (11+ yr) |
| `4` | Future — impossible date; strong hallucination signal |

---

## Reliability Protocol

After completing the full dataset, randomly select 10% of coded papers (blind re-code).

Report **Cohen's κ** for:

- `Expertise_Match` (3-level ordinal)
- `Citation_Role` (5-category nominal)

Target: κ ≥ 0.70 for both variables before proceeding to analysis.

---

## Edge Cases

**No Google Scholar profile found**
: Search institutional faculty page and DBLP. If no publication record is locatable, code `Expertise_Match = 2` (Distant) and note in the Notes field.

**Citation spans multiple domains**
: Assign the primary domain and note secondary domain in Notes.

**Co-authored paper with contradictory expertise**
: Use the most lenient code (closest match) and note both authors' domains.

**Citation appears verbatim elsewhere in literature**
: Code `Is_Hallucinated = 0` (Real) — confirmation in CrossRef or another indexed source is sufficient.
